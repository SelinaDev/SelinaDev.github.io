      <description>Here i&amp;rsquo;ll start an attempt for something I&amp;rsquo;ve wanted to do for a long time. I&amp;rsquo;ve been interested in traditional roguelikes for a while now. Given that I&amp;rsquo;m also interested in game development, it should not come as a surprise that I have looked into how to make a roguelike as well. There is a very nice and reasonably comprehensive tutorial online, that exists in multiple versions. One of the more well known versions has to be the one at Roguelike Tutorials.</description>
