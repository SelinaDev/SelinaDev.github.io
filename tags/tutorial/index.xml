      <description>Part 2: Generic Entity and the Map Continuing from the last tutorial (https://selinadev.github.io/05-rogueliketutorial-01/), we will now move to creating a more generic entity, and then start on the structure of our map.
So let&amp;rsquo;s start with creating out entity class. I want to point out that my approach differs a bit from the original tutorial. In that tutorial all properties of an entity are set in its constructor. A later part eventually uses a factory pattern to create a few prototype entities in code and then spawn copies of them.</description>

      <description>Here i&amp;rsquo;ll start an attempt for something I&amp;rsquo;ve wanted to do for a long time. I&amp;rsquo;ve been interested in traditional roguelikes for a while now. Given that I&amp;rsquo;m also interested in game development, it should not come as a surprise that I have looked into how to make a roguelike as well. There is a very nice and reasonably comprehensive tutorial online, that exists in multiple versions. One of the more well known versions has to be the one at Roguelike Tutorials.</description>
